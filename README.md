<b>Automated Cheque Recognition System</b>

We present here two scenarios where the end user would undergo. One is the online mode and the other is the offline mode. In online mode, A digital cheque is created at the bank side and circulated via their website where there would be a separate portal for uploading cheque from their net banking account. The user uploads his filled digital cheque and uploads in the portal. The filled cheque is made to undergo OCR and AI recognition to extract characters from the cheque and the extracted data is made to digitally sign with Aadhar EKYC in order to validate the authenticity of the data provided. The data is stored using the block chain concepts and later used by the bank to process the necessary details.

The second mode is the offline mode where the user or the customer doesnâ€™t have access to internet facility and so the customer fill up the given physical cheque and hand over it to the bank. The physical cheque is processed by using AI and OCR techniques and also the pre-defined MICR techniques is also added. The generated data is converted to a model and with extra EKYC support at the bank makes the data more secured and digitalized.
